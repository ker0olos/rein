# Rein

A experimental vtuber app using easy to make svg models.

### Story

This app started on 2022 with a lot of ambition and goals, a lot of people
collaborated on it, it was built on Rust to be fast and cloud-based, and a
working demo was sent as a contract proposal to ~~REDACTED~~ corp, Unfortunately
that project will never see the light of day for various reasons.

This however is a more simplified, striped down python version of the project
using the same SVG models system and ML kit.

### How to use

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh download_ml_models.sh
python3 main.py
```
