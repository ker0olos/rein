# Rein

A experimental vtuber app using easy to make svg models.

### Roadmap

This is (rein)carnation of a project I made in 2022, the plan is to update it to
use the standard 52 blendshapes instead of the current landmark method, and
support all those blendshapes in them models.

### How to use

```bash
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements.txt
sh download_ml_models.sh
python3 main.py
```
